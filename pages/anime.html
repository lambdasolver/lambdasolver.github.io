            So you're interested in my taste in anime. Since 2020, I have been an anime fan. I have seen over 150 anime
            so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy watching various genres. I realised that genres I had previously detested in English films were
            actually quite interesting in Anime. So yes, I generally like all genres. The genres I found to be the most
            fascinating among them include horror, thrillers, and slice of life. Yes, you heard correctly; I also enjoy
            the horror genre.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I started watching anime, I used to watch a lot of English films. There, the horror was merely a jump
            scare. It's not horror, though. What I really want is psychological horror, the kind of terror that will
            shock you the most. That fit in with certain horror anime really well.</p>
        <p>
            I also read manga. I read manga whenever I start an anime that is presently running and can't wait for the
            next season. I haven't read a lot of manga. barely even crosses the number 10.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll list my top 5 favourite anime shows and films for you. I'll also share other suggestions for anime that
            didn't place in the top 5, but that I still think are excellent.
        </p>

    <h2>My Favourite Character</h2>
    <p>
        My favourite anime character overall is Light Yagami from Death Note.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hear me out before you start to criticise me. First of all, if you have watched Death Note, you should be aware
        that I only take the Death Note up until L's death into consideration. After that it becomes bogus and it feels
        like Near is using GTA cheatcodes. Additionally, upon L's passing, Light develops a maniacal sense of
        self-worth. He wasn't the smart, perceptive youngster he was when L was alive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's why I like Light. He is really brilliant, to start. From Isagi Yoichi from Blue Lock, Shikamaru from
        Naruto, Senku from Dr. Stone, to Ayanokoji from Classroom of the Elite, I enjoy all intellectual anime
        characters.
    </p>
