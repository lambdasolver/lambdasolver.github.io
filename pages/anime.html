            So you're interested in my taste in anime. Since 2020, I have been an anime fan. I have seen over 150 anime
            so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy watching various genres. I realised that genres I had previously detested in English films were
            actually quite interesting in Anime. So yes, I generally like all genres. The genres I found to be the most
            fascinating among them include horror, thrillers, and slice of life. Yes, you heard correctly; I also enjoy
            the horror genre.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I started watching anime, I used to watch a lot of English films. There, the horror was merely a jump
            scare. It's not horror, though. What I really want is psychological horror, the kind of terror that will
            shock you the most. That fit in with certain horror anime really well.</p>
        <p>
            I also read manga. I read manga whenever I start an anime that is presently running and can't wait for the
            next season. I haven't read a lot of manga. barely even crosses the number 10.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll list my top 5 favourite anime shows and films for you. I'll also share other suggestions for anime that
            didn't place in the top 5, but that I still think are excellent.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a huge collection of Anime Wallpapers. If you want my collection then go <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1NyW2c5CHJK_ytbDbQngI-5pk7w_-1J68" target="_blank">here</a>

        <div class="anime-char">

            <div class="anime-char-img">
                <img src="../images/light-yagami.jpg" alt="Light Yagami" />
            </div>
            <div class="anime-char-des">
                <p>
                    My favourite anime character overall is Light Yagami from Death Note. Also to be precise I like the
                    character Light Yagami portraited in the english dub version of Death Note
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hear me out before you start to criticise me. First of all, if you have watched Death Note, you
                    should be aware
                    that I only take the Death Note up until L's death into consideration. After that it becomes bogus
                    and it feels
                    like Near is using GTA cheatcodes. Additionally, upon L's passing, Light develops a maniacal sense
                    of
                    self-worth. He wasn't the smart, perceptive youngster he was when L was alive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's why I like Light:
                <ul>
                    <li>He is really brilliant, to start. From Isagi Yoichi from Blue Lock, Shikamaru from Naruto, Senku
                        from Dr. Stone, to Ayanokoji from Classroom of the Elite, I enjoy all intellectual anime
                        characters. He is also not a prodigy talent, in contrast to all the other prodigy personalities.
                        He is intelligent with his hardworking. And respect those individuals who, while having little
                        natural skill, have worked incredibly hard to become experts in their subjects. I like Light in
                        part because of this. And this motivates me very much. Since i am always surrounded by very
                        intelligent people in my academic life, this characterist of Light Yagami makes me stay
                        motivated towards my goal of being a Computer Scientist.</li>
                    <li>The second point is highly particular to the dub version. The voice actor did such an amazing
                        job, the way he behaved and speech constantly give the image of someone highly intelligent. You
                        probably already know that when you speak to certain really bright people, their behaviour
                        radiates intelligence, instantly elevating him to a position of great respect. Actually, given
                        his age and character description, I believe the English voice fits him well. He demonstrates
                        his intelligence by the way he thinks and interacts with others. </li>
                    <li>You might now despise me. But I kind of concur with his ideology, the way in which he began
                        doing everything. But once more, 'I kind of agree'</li>
                    <li>And i am aware that many people would accuse him of killing innocent bystanders and manipulating
                        Misa's emotions. However, you already know that what Light is doing is illegal. Then, what is
                        the best approach to dispel the suspicion that someone is watching him to find out if he is the
                        murderer or not? It is to show them that assassination still occurs even when he does nothing.
                        Light is currently limited to acting alone. Ryuk is only an observer, thus he cannot ask him to
                        do it. Therefore, it stands to reason that any criminal who makes the news must be killed, even
                        if they do not pose a serious threat to society.
                        <p>And coming to the Misa's emotion. Dude, Light is engaging in very illegal activities. If he
                            is apprehended, his family will also experience a life suffering in addition to him
                            receiving a death sentence. In that circumstances, every action should be carefully
                            considered and calculated. Misa then arrives with her whining¬†about why Light hasn't called
                            him or does he loves her. He had to manipulate such an unstable girl. Even because Misa L's
                            suspicion on Light increased from 7% to more than 50%. As Samuel Jackson said in the movie
                            Pulp Fiction <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTLXGF0hS7M" target="_blank">"Bitch,
                                be cool"</a> üòÅ. And as you can see, even after Rem passed away, Light could have easily
                            killed Misa and broken his word to Rem, but he chose not to and always made plans that would
                            prevent Misa from being implicated. I don't give a damn if he misled Misa or not. Misa is
                            just a pain in the ass¬†for me.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all the reason why I like this character. And after all this is my personal choice which
                    character I like. So that's it
                </p>

        <div class="fav-animes">
            <p>The majority of the episodes I enjoy the most are from the Slice of Life genre because they teach me
                valuable lessons and because the shows themselves depict the main characters' simple lifestye, which I
                also find to be quite appealing. But there are other genre's also. So here we go:</p>

                    Askeladd. He killed Thors on a mission. Seeing his father die right in front of him to save
                    everyone, Thorfinn becomes revengefull and swears to kill the man Askeladd. But in the path of
                    revenge he kills countless people. And in the end war and his revenge seeking made him worse. Later

                    person. It is such a beautiful anime. The sound designing, and opening and ending songs everything
                    makes this anime very good. You have probably heard the quote "You have no enemies". It was from
                    this anime. Thors tells this line to Thorfinn when Thorfinn takes a sword from his father's trunk.
                    Through out the anime this quote came back again and again and the meaning is explored

                    unmanned combat drones developed by the Republic of San Magnolia, called ‚ÄúJuggernaut‚Äù in answer to
                    the attacks by the autonomous unmanned drones of the neighboring Empire of Giad, the ‚ÄúLegion‚Äù. Even

The next day Kakeru was absent. He comes back to school much later. Naho finds that they day they invited Kakeru, since Kakeru didn't go to home early his mother committed suicide. And Kakeru makes himself responcible for his mother's death. The more days passes on Naho tries to drag Kakeru out of this, but Kakeru more and more makes himself guilty. Gradually Naho felt that she fell in love with Kakeru. In future Kakeru is dead. So Naho married to Suwa. So from school Suwa always like Naho. But seeing Naho hurt he pushes Naho to comfort Kakeru.
